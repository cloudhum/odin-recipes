    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large red onion</li>
            <li>3/4 cup vinegar</li>
            <li>1-2 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the vinegar mixture. In a small saucepan, stir together the vinegar, water, salt and your desired amount of sweetener. Cook over medium-high heat until the mixture reaches a simmer. (Or alternately, you can heat the mixture in the microwave.)</li>
            <li>Combine in a jar. Place the thinly-sliced onions in a mason jar. Pour the hot vinegar mixture over the onions, screw on the lid, and shake the onions briefly until they are evenly coated with the vinegar mixture.</li>
            <li>Marinate. Let the onions marinate for 30 minutes. (You may need to press the onions down with a spoon so that they are all submerged under the vinegar mixture.)</li>
            <li>Serve. Serve immediately, or refrigerate the onions in a sealed container for up to 2 weeks.</li>
        </ol>
