    <p>A standard Mexican breakfast, chilaquiles turn yesterday's tortillas into a tasty base for an assortment of possible toppings. The cook cuts or tears the corn tortilla into triangles, then fries them in oil until they turn slightly brown and crispy. Once cooled, the chips get doused in a sauce that can range from mild red to spicy green chile to any variation of mole, and topped with crema and salty crumbled cheese. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil </li>
            <li>2 to 3 cups tortilla chips (approximately 30 chips from a bag)</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups green or red salsa </li>
            <li>1/2 cup crumbled queso fresco or Cotija cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Mexican crema (or substitute regular sour cream thinned with a splash of milk)</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Lightly coat a large frying pan with vegetable oil. Heat over medium-high heat until oil shimmers. </li>
            <li>Spread tortilla chips in pan. </li>
            <li>Quickly pour salsa over chips and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer the chips in sauce, undisturbed, until chips absorb some of the liquid and soften, for approximately 10 minutes. </li>
            <li>Divide chilaquiles between two plates; sprinkle half of the cheese on each and drizzle with half of the crema.</li>
        </ol>
